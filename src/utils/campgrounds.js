    description:
      "Mt. Ulap is located in Itogon, Benguet. It is one of the most visited mountains in the Philippines. It offers scenic views of the Cordillera mountain range and it is often called mini Mt. Ugo because it provides the same view of pine ridges similar to its counterpart. Mt. Ulap has a height of 1846 meters above sea level or 6056 feet. The jump-off point of Mt. Ulap is just 45 minutes drive from Baguio City and because of its closeness to Baguio City, it becomes a perfect day hike for hikers and mountaineers seeking peace of mind with mother nature.",

      "Onay Beach is a long, long stretch, with one side fringed with thick vegetation and the other soaked in turquoise water. As I stood at the mouth of the main access point in the middle of the cove, I could hardly see its north end, seemingly disappearing in the droplets that the waves spray into the air.",

    title: "Seven Sisters Waterfall",
    description:
      "Seven Sister is a popular waterfall located on the Gangtok- Lachung Highway, around 32 kilometres away from Gangtok. As the name suggests, the seven different waterfalls harmoniously arranged sideways on a wide rugged cliff seem distinct if watched from a distance. It becomes a must see place in Gangtok after rains, when the falls come into a fierce life offering an awe-inspiring view. The gurgling water of the fall plunges out of the lush green vegetation plastering the rugged cliffs, falls over the limestones making a thunderous sound. The picturesque beauty of the fall makes it tourists stopping point to relax and rejuvenate.",
